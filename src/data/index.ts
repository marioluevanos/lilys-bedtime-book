    {
      content:
        "The stars were bright, the moon was high, Lily and Kiko gave a sigh. At Chuckle Cheese’s, guards they’d be, From twelve to six, no time for tea!",
      synopsis:
        "Outside a quirky, neon-lit family restaurant named Chuckle Cheese’s, Lily and her brave pup Kiko arrive for their new job as nighttime guards. It’s just before midnight, and the sky is clear and sparkly. The parking lot is empty and quiet—but something inside seems to flicker in the dark.",
    },
    {
      content:
        "Inside the halls, so big and wide, They flipped the switch and stepped inside. The lights all flickered, floors did creak, And then they heard a chuckle—EEK!",
      synopsis:
        "Lily and Kiko unlock the front doors and enter the dark restaurant. The stage, arcade, and dining booths are cast in eerie shadows. As the power comes on with a flicker, a faint, mechanical giggle echoes from the animatronic stage area, setting the tone for a spooky first shift.",
    },
    {
      content:
        "The stage held bots with plastic grins, In costumes worn and weathered skins. They stood so still with lifeless stare— But Lily knew they weren’t all there.",
      synopsis:
        "Lily walks slowly past the animatronic stage. Four characters—mouse, chicken, bear, and clown—stand eerily still, frozen mid-song. Kiko growls low. Something feels wrong. One bot’s head turns slightly as they pass—but when Lily looks again, it’s still.",
    },
    {
      content:
        "The clock struck twelve, a loud DING-DONG, And Kiko barked, “That felt all wrong.” The cameras blinked, the screens went black— Then thumping feet began to smack!",
      synopsis:
        "As the stroke of midnight echoes through the building, the lights dim and the security camera monitors go fuzzy. Kiko’s ears perk up, and the sound of heavy mechanical footsteps echoes from the kitchen. Something is definitely awake—and walking!",
    },
    {
      content:
        "They ran to hide near soda pop, And peeked out from the slushy shop. The bear bot passed with glowing eyes, And sang, “Let’s play!” to their surprise.",
      synopsis:
        "Lily and Kiko duck behind a row of old soda machines. They watch in fright as the animatronic bear, blinking with red eyes, marches past and begins to sing a glitchy version of the birthday jingle. The bot seems to scan the area for movement.",
    },
    {
      content:
        "With cameras back, they hatched a plan, To trick the bots with fans that ran. They placed them near the hallway door, And hoped the noise would help them score.",
      synopsis:
        "Lily rewires an old desk fan and places it near one of the hallways. She hopes the buzzing noise will draw the animatronics away. Kiko helps by nudging cords and dragging a snack bag as bait. They hurry back to the security room to monitor movement.",
    },
    {
      content:
        "Night number one soon reached its end, The bots went stiff around the bend. “Just two more nights!” said Lily brave, As Kiko wagged, a silent wave.",
      synopsis:
        "At exactly 6:00 AM, the bots freeze mid-step, lights dim, and a sudden calm returns to the restaurant. Lily slumps into her chair, relieved. Kiko curls at her feet. The danger is over—for now. The sun begins to rise outside the window.",
    },
    {
      content:
        "Night two began with bolts and bangs, The chicken bot leaped from the stands! She chased them through the party hall, While laughing like a bouncing ball!",
      synopsis:
        "During the second night, the animatronics activate faster and with more intensity. The chicken bot jumps off the stage and begins darting down the party hall. Lily and Kiko narrowly dodge tables and balloons while trying to escape its flashing eyes.",
    },
    {
      content:
        "They locked her in the ball pit tight, With nets and chairs they set just right. The clown bot groaned but slipped on pies— Which Kiko flung with perfect ties!",
      synopsis:
        "Thinking quickly, Lily lures the chicken bot into the ball pit, where they trap her using party nets and folding chairs. As the clown bot stumbles forward, Kiko throws cream pies left from a birthday display, making the bot trip and fall with a thud.",
    },
    {
      content:
        "Night three arrived with eerie song, The mouse bot danced all night long. He whispered secrets in the air— Of secrets deep beneath the chair.",
      synopsis:
        "On the final night, the mouse animatronic activates alone, but it’s different now—calmer, almost curious. He hums old songs and mutters in half-glitched speech, revealing there's something hidden beneath the restaurant’s main chair on stage. Lily investigates cautiously.",
    },
    {
      content:
        "They found a switch and turned it fast, The bots all froze and breathed their last. The room grew bright, the curse undone— Their watch was over. Shift was won!",
      synopsis:
        "Lily finds a hidden shutdown switch inside a compartment beneath the stage. She flips it just as the animatronics begin to stir again. One by one, they freeze and dim. A soft chime plays as the lights return to normal. Dawn breaks. Peace at last.",
    },
    {
      content:
        "They locked the doors and waved goodbye, No more bots to make them cry. Kiko barked, “We’re safe, hooray!” And off they went to start the day.",
      synopsis:
        "With all three nights survived and the animatronics powered down, Lily and Kiko smile in triumph. They shut off the lights, lock the doors, and head home just as the sun rises. The danger is gone, and their bravery saved the day (and night).",

    "Some animatronics use facial recognition and motion sensors to interact with guests—but only during operating hours!",
